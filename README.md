PopcornBCN is a website that allows users to see the movie listings for cinemas in Barcelona. Each movie will have its details, showtimes, and user comments. Users can check where it's being screened, in which version, and how much it costs.

For frontend I'm using JS Vanilla, HTML and CFF.
For backend I'm using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
